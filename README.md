# Dev Blog

This is a pelican project that contains the source text that I use to generate my blog
at http://devblog.greylurk.com

## Requirements
This uses the pelican site generator software to generate and upload static HTML to my site
for my blog.  To install the correct version of pelican, just do:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.pip
```

I recommend using your favorite virtualenv container.  I use virtualenvwrapper, but your mileage may vary.
